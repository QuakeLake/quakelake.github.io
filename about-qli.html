    <h1>About Quake Lake Industries</h1>
    <h2>For several years before 2001, I was a network administrator and desktop support technician. In 2000, I was asked to create technical documentation to describe a client's internal IT processes. Despite having no formal training or experience, I'd been writing creatively for most of my life and was the only administrator on staff with any suitable knowledge.
    <br><br>
    My first technical documentation project went very well, and it sparked my greater interest. In 2001, I chose to leave network administration to enroll in the English program at the University of Alberta with an eye toward a new career in technical documentation. 
    <br><br>
    In 2005, I achieved an English degree having received two academic scholarships. I accepted my first full-time employment role as a dedicated Technical Writer in early 2006, and quickly moved beyond introductory tasks. In 2007, I developed my first comprehensive documentation strategy for a new company that had never worked with a technical writer.
    <br><br>
    In late 2008, a recruitment agency contacted me to propose a switch to contract Techical Writer roles. I liked the idea of working with diverse clients in diverse industries, and I relish challenges, so I accepted and established Quake Lake Industries as my contracting vehicle in early 2009. 
    <br><br>
    As a neat side note, the name Quake Lake Industries comes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_Lake">Earthquake Lake</a> in southern Montana. I was driving to Grand Teton National Park and Jackson Hole, Wyoming shortly before starting my first contract role, and was thinking about names for the company that I would establish after my trip. The name <i>Earthquake Lake</i> stuck with me through many hours on the road, and I used that as my inspiration when I got home.
    <br><br>
    As my experience grew, clients became increasingly interested in my unique ability to assertively manage documentation projects and to develop realistic, beneficial documentation strategies. A client representative once told me that, <i>"It's pretty easy to find decent technical writers, but rare to find one who can clearly explain why changes make sense and actually sell a strategy."</i>
    <br><br>
    My own experience over nearly 20 years has shown that statement to be accurate. I've worked with many skilled and talented technical writers, most of whom lacked the confidence or desire to effectively spearhead a strategy or to advocate process improvements.
    <br><br>
    In recent years, my interests and skills have lead me to specialize in strategy, planning, and efficiency improvements rather than producing technical documentation content myself. I've named the specialization Technical Documentation Advisory services.
