          <p style="font-family:arial">
            During <b>18 years as a technical writer</b> in a wide variety of industries, I’ve worked with many clients who lack experience managing technical documentation projects. 
            <br><br>
            In those cases, clients often underestimate the time and effort required to facilitate a documentation project, and often choose a writer based on best-guess criteria. 
            <br><br>
            I’ve watched several projects stall or fail entirely when the client learns the time and resource commitments required to produce <b>accurate, safe, maintainable documentation</b>. 
            <br><br>
            With that in mind, Quake Lake Industries is proud to launch a <b>Technical Documentation Advisory service</b> to provide diverse expertise to clients <b>who are unfamiliar with the documentation process or have had unsatisfactory results from previous documentation projects</b>.
            <br><br>
            After discussions with the client and an analysis of any existing material, I will provide <b>customized written recommendations</b> for the following –
            <li style="font-family:arial">subject matter expert <b>resource requirements and expectations</b>
            <li style="font-family:arial">document templates and look-and-feel guidelines based on <b>industry best practices</b>
            <li style="font-family:arial">best-practice <b>document review processes</b> and expectations
            <li style="font-family:arial">a <b>document storage</b> strategy
            <li style="font-family:arial">a <b>periodic document re-review</b> strategy
            <li style="font-family:arial">documentation development software
            <li style="font-family:arial">an <b>optimal technical writer candidate profile</b>. I will also participate in the candidate interview process, if requested
            <p style="font-family:arial">
            My advisory service provides the following client benefits –
            <li style="font-family:arial">an additional <b>revenue stream</b> for recruitment agency partners
            <li style="font-family:arial"><b>less time wasted</b> recruiting and interviewing <b>unsuitable candidates</b>
            <li style="font-family:arial"><b>a greater likelihood of project success</b> with a client understanding of what’s required to properly facilitate and support technical documentation
            <li style="font-family:arial">a strong project platform with much of the <b>pre-work completed</b>
            <li style="font-family:arial"><b>fewer surprises</b> for both clients and agency partners
            <br><br>
            I’m happy to discuss the service or to answer any questions.
